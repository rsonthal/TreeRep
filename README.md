Learning Tree structures and Tree metrics

The TreeRep notebook has the code to run the metric to tree structure experiments. It also has the Neighbor Joining code

The TreeRepVersion1 is version1 of the metric to tree metric. The version 3 file is the 3rd version. I am currently working on this version, though I already have ideas for version 4 and 5.
